- I am an elderly citizen, and I have trouble with commuting frequently. I would like for a way for my prescriptions to be ready once I arrive at my pharmacy.

- As a pharmacist, I see a large volume of prescriptions during the day, which results in longer wait times for our patients. I would like for a way to see the list of prescriptions
so that they can be attended to as quickly as possible. 

- I am a person who is very new to priscriptions and i am not completely sure what the drug that i will be taking actually does. I would like to be able to search up drugs and 
be able to read about the drug's information.

- I have been prescribed the same drug for a number of years, so I would like the program to resend my priscription everytime i need a refill, so i dont have to bring my form 
all the time

- I am moving two a new city, and i would like to send my new pharmacy my new information.
